A detailed review exploring the metabolism of the relatively inert C3 compounds acetone and propylene, which despite their reactivity and toxicity, are used as primary carbon sources.Within the review we explore the diversity of mechanisms for propylene and acetone assimilation as well as dive deep into the structure and mechanisms of carboxylation reactions. Life is a C2 based system (think acetyl-CoA) so for assimilation of C3 compounds carboxylation is required. Achieving the carboxylation step while expending the least amount of energy is necessary for many of these prokaryotes to survive.
