This paper describes the crystal structures of acetone carboxylase found in three different mechanistic states. These states allowed us to propose a mechanism of substrate activation and carboxylation. There are a limited amount of carboxylation enzymes with even fewer mechanisms of action. Acetone carboxylase represents a unique non-biotin containing ATP dependent mechanism which could help with future CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration biotechnologies.
