I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Institute of Biological Chemistry](https://ibc.wsu.edu/) at Washington State University in [John Peters' Lab](https://labs.wsu.edu/peters/). I am currently studying the aerobic physiology of nitrogen-fixing bacteria using laboratory and modeling techniques. I received my bachelor's degree from Western Colorado University, studying biology and chemistry.  
 
I am generally interested in the complexity of biological systems and their internal regulations. Being a capable biologist requires a broad understanding from ecology to enzyme mechanisms, all of which help us formulate some of the biggest questions
 
Iâ€™m also an outdoor sports enthusiast who enjoys cycling, hiking and camping. In my free time I bike the hills of the Palouse as well as the mountains of the West
