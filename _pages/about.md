I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Institute of Biological Chemistry](https://ibc.wsu.edu/) at Washington State University in [John Peters' Lab](https://labs.wsu.edu/peters/). I am currently studying the aerobic physiology of nitrogen fixing bacteria using laboratory and modeling techniques. I received my Bachelor's degree from Western Colorado University studying biology and chemistry.  
 
I am generally interested in the complexity of biological systems and the internal regulation of these complex systems. I believe being a capable biologist requires an understanding from ecology down to enzyme mechanisms, as all help answer some of the biggest questions in biology.  
 
I am also an avid cyclist and spend most of my free time riding my bike in the hills of the Palouse as well in the mountains around the west.
