I am a Ph.D. canidate in the Insitute of Biological Chemistry at Washington State University in John Peters' Lab. I am currently studying the aerobic physiology of nitrogen fixation using labratory and modeling techniques. I recived my Bacherlors degree from Western Colorado University studying biology and Chemistry. 

I am generally interested in the complexity of biological systems and the internal regulation of these complex systems. I belive being a capable biologist requires an understanding from ecology down to enzyme mechanism as all help answer some of the biggest questions in biology. 

I am an avid cyclist and spend most of my free time riding my bike in the hills of the Palouse as well in the mountains around the west.
